# Motion Detector
This Python script uses the OpenCV library to create a simple motion detection and alarm system. It captures video from your computer's webcam and detects motion within the video frames. When motion is detected, it plays an alarm sound to alert you. This script can be used as a basic security camera or to monitor a specific area for movement.
